# OneSignal + Vue.js

This example project demonstrates how to integrate OneSignal into your Vue.js app. You can use this project as a boilerplate or a reference for your project.

If you are interested in learning more about this project, check out [this blog post](#link).

## Running this sample

This sample assumes that you already have a OneSignal app created. If you don't have one made already, you'll need to create it before starting.

1. Run `yarn` to install packages
2. Set the app id in `main.js`
3. Start the app, `yarn serve`

Note that you will need to have a OneSignal app created before this example will work. Check the [Web Push Quickstart](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/web-push-quickstart#step-1-choose-integration) for guidance on a OneSignal app.
